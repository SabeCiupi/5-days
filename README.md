# 🚀 5 Days of Code - Game Development Challenge 🎮

## **📌 About This Challenge**
This repository is my **5-day coding challenge**, where I focus on **game development, algorithms, and programming concepts**.  
Each day, I build a **small project or feature**, improving my skills in **C++, C#, Unity, and other game-related technologies**.

## **📌 Challenge Goals**
- Practice **coding daily** for a full year.
- Improve **problem-solving and logic** in programming.
- Develop **game mechanics and interactive applications**.
- Learn **new technologies** related to game development.

## **📌 Daily Progress Tracker**
This table keeps track of each day's project:

| **Day**   | **Description** | **Language/Tech** |
|:-----------:|:----------------:|:-----------------:|
| Day 1     | Recapped **variables, data types, operators, and conditional statements** in C++. Built a **roulette game** to apply these concepts. Covered **logical operators, precedence, and user input handling**.| C++ |
| Day 2     | Built a **simple calculator with UI** in Unity. Covered **UI elements, button interactions, input handling, and real-time result display**.| C# (Unity) |
| Day 3     | Created a **3D dice rolling simulation** in Unity. Implemented **realistic physics-based dice roll, automatic face detection**, and multiple dice support. Used **Rigidbody, Colliders, and custom 3D dice model from Blender**.| C# (Unity), Blender |
| Day 4     | Learned the basics of **Unity Scenes, GameObjects, Components, and Transforms**. Explored how to **create and manage scenes, organize GameObjects, and apply components**. Implemented a **movement, rotation, and scaling system** using a C# script. | C# (Unity) |
| Day 5     | Learned **prefabs, randomized object spawning, and project organization** in Unity. Built a **Mushroom Spawner system** that dynamically generates mushrooms at random positions using **instantiation, randomization, and prefab management**. | C# (Unity) |

## **📌 How to Use This Repository**
- Each day's project is stored in a separate **folder** (`day1`, `day2`, etc.).
- Every folder contains:
  - The **source code** for the day's project.
  - A **README.md** with an explanation of the project.
